Data mesh framework / journey map/ reflection canvas / maturity curve 

**1. Getting Data Mesh Off the Ground:** Industries of all kinds and sizes are looking forward to scale and monetize their data. While Data Mesh gives a lot of hope to the industry, how easy or tough is it for startups and big elephants to embark on this journey?

**2. Key assumptions involved in the Data mesh journey:** With all the blessings, the decision for data mesh adoption has been done. Is this enough? What assumptions must be socialized? Is this important? 

**3. Key stakeholder alignment: Producers, Consumers, Data Governance ,Data Management, IT:** Data Mesh is not a technology or tool, its a socio-technical approach, and needs stakeholder alignment more than any other data initiative. What is the path of least resistance? What are the possible options that has worked or can work?

**4. Risk and Compliance, Finance:** When and how do we need to involve the key organizations units like risk, compliance and finance? This also depends on the type of the industry.

**5. Do we need Data Mesh?:** Most important, do we adopt mesh because everyone is doing it? What are the business objectives in short term and long term? How to take the right decision before shaking up the organization?

**6. Identify Key Benefits:** Once the decision is taken, it is important to note down carefully the business benefits for the organization. This will help to take go-no go at various milestones and justify the investments.

**7. Identify Milestones and measurements:** Once the business benefits have been identified, short measurable milestones must be defined and benefits should be regularly evaluated much like Mesh OKRs.

**8. Identify ROI measurement parameters:** Next is to check, what mechanisms should be in place to regularly measure ROI and keep doing course corrections and decide on how much to mesh it up?

**9. Identify phases:** Phase out the implementation and this is different from milestones which should mostly be business driven, but phases should be execution driven.

**10. Identify earlier partners and champions:** Engage active stakeholders and champions. Having great partners is important to have solid implementation that gives space and allows exploration.

**11. Scope out MVP:** The most important step for success story in the organization, is combination of all of the above and formalize MVP scope with your champion team.

**12. Identify Tools and Build partners:** Then comes the technical solution which must enable Data Meshiness and have a platform as per DATSIS principle.

**13. Identify Capability building Ways:** Build up your team. What are the options, hire vs contracting vs training?

**14. Start Data Mesh Literacy:** Socializing this approach and have educational initiatives across the organization can do wonders.

**15. Identify Gamification areas:** By this time, there might be need to scale and encourage adoption. Gamification might help. What are the options?

**16. Identify Heavy lifting:** This might need operational efficiency and ways of working, operating model, that is beyond innovation to sustain the initiative.

**17. Identify Anti Patterns:** What are the corners use cases, which might not want to be meshed up or rather not be meshed up? Identifying these patterns is important. As we say, sometimes it is more important to identify what not to do. This might need special attention and identifying early might save quite an energy and motivation.
